# Changelog

## v0.2.0 - 2026-06-17

RedeemLoop Phase 0 has been realigned as a non-issuing voucher payment gateway.

### Added

- `@redeemloop/core` with v0.2 protocol types, validators, idempotency helpers, and the PaymentIntent state machine.
- `@redeemloop/adapters` with EVM, PSBT builder, wallet, and indexer adapter interfaces.
- `@redeemloop/sdk` with a TypeScript client for entitlements, bindings, PaymentIntents, and settlement proofs.
- v0.2 Fastify APIs for merchants, merchant vaults, entitlements, Asset Bindings, PaymentIntents, settlement proofs, and webhook endpoints.
- Receipt proof handling that advances PaymentIntents and triggers dry-run mark-as-paid adapters.
- v0.2 webhook endpoint test requests with `X-RedeemLoop-Timestamp`, `X-RedeemLoop-Nonce`, and HMAC signature headers.
- Local Phase 0 console for Asset Binding, Voucher Tender, PaymentIntent, receipt confirmation, and mark-as-paid demo flows.
- v0.2 docs, whitepaper, construction guide, API model, boundary document, integration guide, commerce adapter guide, and release notes.
- Bilingual English/Chinese README for the public release.

### Changed

- Public positioning changed from an issuance/redemption system to "bring your own voucher asset, RedeemLoop binds and settles."
- Commerce flow now centers on external voucher payment and mark-as-paid instead of commerce-order workaround language.
- The Solidity package is documented as an EVM ERC-20 voucher asset example, not a core issuance module.
- Legacy v0.1 relayer routes remain only as compatibility coverage while new integrations use `/v1/payment-intents` and `/v1/settlement/proofs`.

### Security

- Added validator coverage for voucher asset descriptors, bindings, PaymentIntents, and settlement proofs.
- Added proof idempotency keys and mark-as-paid idempotency keys.
- Commerce adapter metadata now carries `intentId` and generic `assetId`.
- Public docs clarify that RedeemLoop does not custody assets or private keys.

### Known Limitations

- Service state is still in-memory.
- Mark-as-paid adapters default to dry-run unless platform credentials are configured.
- EVM ERC-20 tender is the only implemented runtime path; Bitcoin, Fractal, Rune, and Inscription support is currently interface-level.
- Contracts are unaudited example code.
